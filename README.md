- AWS bedrock for support chat using RAG
- Angular frontend (Merchant - packed, assign tracking no. and delivery man)

## Required Android Permissions
The application requires:
Internet access
Camera access
Location access
Notification permission

## Application Architecture

The mobile application communicates with the SmartMart Spring Boot backend using REST APIs.

1. The delivery person logs in.
2. The backend returns a JWT and user ID.
3. An OkHttp interceptor adds the JWT to protected API requests.
4. The application retrieves orders assigned to the logged-in delivery person.
5. Delivery status changes and proof-of-delivery information are sent to the backend.

## Delivery Workflow

`PACKED → PICKED_UP → DELIVERED`

- **PACKED:** The order is assigned and ready for collection.
- **PICKED_UP:** The delivery person has collected the order.
- **DELIVERED:** The order has been delivered with photo proof.

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides the delivery person with an overview of their delivery workload display in-project and completed jobs.

It displays:
- The delivery person's name.
- The number of assigned delivery jobs.
- The number of in-progress deliveries.
- The number of completed deliveries.
- Quick access to the in-progress and completed delivery lists.
- Notifications for newly assigned delivery jobs.

## In-Progress Delivery List
The in-progress delivery list displays active jobs assigned to the logged-in delivery person.

It includes orders with the following statuses:
- `PACKED` — The order has been packed and assigned to the delivery person.
- `PICKED_UP` — The order has been collected and is being delivered.

After an order is marked as `DELIVERED`, it is removed from the in-progress list and displayed in the completed delivery list.

## Completed Delivery List

The completed delivery list displays the logged-in delivery person's delivery history.

It includes orders with the `DELIVERED` status and displays information such as:

- Order ID.
- Tracking number.
- Recipient's name.
- Delivery address.
- Delivery completion date and time.
- Delivery status.
- Proof-of-delivery information.

## Map and Recipient Contact
The delivery details screen allows the delivery person to:

- View the delivery destination on a map.
- if needed,  Open the phone dialler with the recipient's contact number.

## Delivery Support Chatbot

The application includes an LLM-powered support chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The chatbot:

- Retrieves information from the delivery-support knowledge base.
- Uses the retrieved information as context for the LLM.
- Answers operational questions about e.g unsuccessful deliveries, unavailable recipients and damaged parcels.

## Firebase Push Notifications

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) sends a real-time push notification when a merchant assigns a delivery job.
After login, the application registers its latest FCM device token with the Spring Boot backend. The backend uses this token to send job-assignment notifications to the correct delivery person.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Android SDK
- Android emulator or physical Android device
- Java 17 or the version required by the project
- Running SmartMart Spring Boot backend
- Firebase configuration file: `google-services.json`

## Related Merchant Use Case (Smartcart web application - merchant - order / delivery)

### Assign Delivery Job

**Actor:** Merchant

**Precondition:** The customer has placed and paid for an order. The order status is `PAID`.

## Merchant Order Delivery Management — Web Application

![Merchant Order Delivery Management](https://pwt-bucket-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/delivery-app-screen-shoot.png)

### Main Flow

1. The merchant receives the customer's paid order through the SmartCart web application.
2. The merchant prepares and packs the order.
3. The merchant opens the delivery management page.
4. The merchant changes the order status from `PAID` to `PACKED`.
5. The merchant enters a unique tracking number.
6. The merchant selects a registered delivery person.
7. The merchant saves the delivery details.
8. The Spring Boot backend updates the order record.
9. Firebase Cloud Messaging sends a job-assignment notification.
10. The assigned delivery person receives the notification.
11. The job appears in the delivery mobile application's in-progress list.

### Postconditions

- The order status is `PACKED`.
- A unique tracking number is assigned.
- A registered delivery person is assigned.
- The delivery person receives a push notification.
- The assigned job is available in the delivery mobile application.

### Validation Rules

- Only registered delivery personnel can be selected.
- A tracking number is required when assigning a delivery person.
- The tracking number must be unique.
- The order must have `PACKED` status before it can be assigned.

### Workflow

`PAID → PACKED → Assigned to Delivery Person → FCM Notification`
